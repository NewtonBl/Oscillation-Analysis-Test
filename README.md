This was an investigatory look into the analysis of oscillation/vibration data.
Primarily looking at finding the starting point and a specific end point (when oscilaltion falls below a given level), and then calculating the time it took to dampen the oscillation. 
Generates a .pdf plot of the oscillation data.
